    "\n",
    "### 🔰 BEGINNER EXPLANATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a 200-page book and someone asks: *\"What did the author say about machine learning on page 87?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** LLMs have a limited \"attention span\" (context window):\n",
    "- GPT-3.5-Turbo: ~4,000 tokens (~16,000 characters)\n",
    "- GPT-4: ~8,000 tokens (~32,000 characters)\n",
    "- You **can't** fit a whole book in one query!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Split the book into smaller **chunks**:\n",
    "1. Each chunk is small enough for the LLM\n",
    "2. Search finds the **relevant chunks** (like page 87)\n",
    "3. Only send those chunks to the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "If you split text randomly:\n",
    "```\n",
    "❌ BAD SPLIT:\n",
    "Chunk 1: \"The transformer architecture revolutionized NLP. It uses self-att\"\n",
    "Chunk 2: \"ention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel. This allows...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"attention\" is cut in half! 😱\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good splitters** respect boundaries (paragraphs, sentences, words):\n",
    "```\n",

    "**RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** is your go-to splitter for 90% of cases.\n",

    "1. Tries to split on **double newlines** (\\n\\n) → paragraphs\n",
    "2. If chunks still too big, splits on **single newlines** (\\n) → lines\n",
    "3. If still too big, splits on **periods** (.) → sentences\n",
    "4. If still too big, splits on **spaces** ( ) → words\n",

    "### 🎉 What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Text splitting is necessary because **LLMs have limited context windows**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** is the recommended default\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Chunk size** determines precision vs context trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Overlap** (20%) preserves context across boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Different content types need different splitters\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Best practice:** chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200 for general text\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔰 Beginner\n",
    "1. Load a PDF and split it with chunk_size=500, overlap=100\n",
    "2. Count total chunks created\n",
    "3. Print first and last chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎓 Intermediate\n",
    "1. Compare chunk sizes (500, 1000, 2000) on the same document\n",
    "2. Create a chart showing # of chunks vs chunk size\n",
    "3. Test different overlap percentages (10%, 20%, 30%)\n",
